Clock application to play dawn chorus at the set time (cf the system clock) - a gentle alternative to an "alarm" clock for folk who are used to waking up to the birds.

Some work still to do to restrict what can can go into the hours and minutes boxes, as well as a button to stop the application (wip).

Module dependencies in (current) unpackaged version - datetime, time, tkinter, pydub. All can be installed via pip3.

For pyaudio - may also need :
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio

Install to local folder and run on the command line with :
python3 natureclock.py
or
python3 natureclock_simple.py
